# Socket.IO Real-Time Events

For the full IoT → BullMQ (`transaction_queue` / `alert_queue`) → Stellar → anomaly detection
flow that produces `location:update` and `anomaly:detected`, see
[Telemetry Ingestion Pipeline](./telemetry-pipeline.md).

## Connection

- Endpoint: `ws(s)://<host>/socket.io/`
- Transport: WebSocket (Socket.IO v4)
- Auth handshake: client must send a JWT in the Socket.IO `auth` payload.

Example client connection:

```ts
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';

const socket = io('https://api.navin.local', {
  transports: ['websocket'],
  auth: {
    token: 'eyJhbGciOiJI...' // raw JWT, no "Bearer " prefix
  },
});
```

- The server uses `src/infra/socket/io.ts` and `src/shared/middleware/socketAuth.ts`.
- Valid JWTs are required to establish a connection and are attached to `socket.user`.
- Once connected, the server maintains an active socket registry and automatically cleans up rooms and state on `disconnecting` / `disconnect`.

## Authentication and handshake

1. Client connects to the Socket.IO endpoint.
2. The client includes an `auth.token` field containing the **raw JWT** (no `Bearer ` prefix).
3. `socketAuth` validates the token, populates `socket.user`, and allows the connection.
4. If authentication fails, the socket connection is rejected.

## Client subscription pattern

The client can subscribe to shipment-specific updates by joining a shipment room.

- Emit `join_shipment` with a shipment ID to start receiving events for that shipment.
- Emit `leave_shipment` with a shipment ID to stop receiving events for that shipment.

Example:

```ts
socket.emit('join_shipment', shipmentId);
socket.on('room_joined', payload => {
  console.log('Joined shipment room', payload);
});

socket.emit('leave_shipment', shipmentId);
socket.on('room_left', payload => {
  console.log('Left shipment room', payload);
});
```

> **Note:** There is no `join_notification` or equivalent event. `notification:new` is
> emitted directly to a recipient-scoped room (`userId` or `organizationId`) by the
> server; the client does not join that room explicitly.

## Events emitted by the server

### `location:update`

Emitted when new telemetry arrives for a shipment (replaces the former `telemetry_update` event).

Payload schema:

```ts
interface TelemetryUpdatePayload {
  telemetryId: string;
  shipmentId: string;
  sensorId: string;
  temperature: number;
  humidity: number;
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  batteryLevel: number;
  timestamp: string; // ISO 8601 UTC
  dataHash: string;
  anchorStatus: 'PENDING_ANCHOR' | 'ANCHORED' | 'ANCHOR_FAILED';
  stellarTxHash?: string;
}
```

### `anomaly:detected`

Emitted when the backend detects an anomaly in shipment telemetry (replaces the former `anomaly_detected` event).

Payload schema:

```ts
interface AnomalyAlertPayload {
  anomalyId: string;
  shipmentId: string;
  type:
    | 'TEMPERATURE_EXCEEDED'
    | 'TEMPERATURE_BELOW_MIN'
    | 'HUMIDITY_EXCEEDED'
    | 'HUMIDITY_BELOW_MIN'
    | 'BATTERY_LOW';
  severity: 'LOW' | 'MEDIUM' | 'HIGH';
  message: string;
  timestamp: string; // ISO 8601 UTC
  resolved: boolean;
}
```

### `shipment:status`

Emitted when a shipment status changes (replaces the former `status_update` event).

Payload schema:

```ts
interface StatusUpdatePayload {
  shipmentId: string;
  status:
    | 'CREATED'
    | 'PICKUP_CONFIRMED'
    | 'IN_TRANSIT'
    | 'CUSTOMS_CLEARED'
    | 'OUT_FOR_DELIVERY'
    | 'DELIVERED'
    | 'SETTLEMENT_INITIATED'
    | 'SETTLEMENT_COMPLETED'
    | 'CANCELLED';
  milestones?: Array<{
    name: string;
    timestamp: string | Date;
    description?: string | null;
    userId?: string | null;
    walletAddress?: string | null;
  }>;
  updatedAt?: string | Date;
}
```

### `settlement:status`

Emitted when `updatePaymentStatusService` or `disputeSettlementService` transitions a payment/escrow record. Only sockets joined to the shipment room for `shipmentId` receive the event. Replaces the former `payment_status_changed` event.

`txHash` is included when the status transition involves an on-chain Stellar transaction (e.g. escrow release).

Payload schema:

```ts
interface SettlementStatusPayload {
  paymentId: string;
  shipmentId: string;
  oldStatus: string;
  newStatus: string;
  amount: number;
  txHash?: string; // Stellar tx hash — present for on-chain transitions
  timestamp: string; // ISO 8601 UTC
}
```

Example:

```json
{
  "paymentId": "64f1c2...",
  "shipmentId": "64f1a0...",
  "oldStatus": "Pending",
  "newStatus": "Released",
  "amount": 1500,
  "txHash": "a3b8c1...",
  "timestamp": "2026-07-24T21:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### `notification:new`

Emitted directly to a user or organisation room (not a shipment room). Use this event for user-scoped notifications such as anomaly alerts, milestone updates, and system messages.

The emitter `emitNotificationNew(recipientId, payload)` in `src/infra/socket/io.ts` targets the room keyed by `recipientId` (a userId or organizationId). Clients **do not** join this room explicitly; the server manages membership.

Payload schema:

```ts
interface NotificationPayload {
  notificationId: string;
  recipientId: string;   // userId or organizationId
  type: string;          // e.g. 'ANOMALY_ALERT' | 'MILESTONE' | 'SYSTEM'
  title: string;
  body: string;
  referenceId?: string;  // shipmentId, paymentId, etc.
  referenceType?: string; // e.g. 'SHIPMENT' | 'PAYMENT'
  timestamp: string;     // ISO 8601 UTC
  read: boolean;
}
```

### `room_joined`

Emitted after the client successfully joins a shipment room.

Payload example:

```json
{
  "shipmentId": "<shipmentId>",
  "room": "shipment_<shipmentId>"
}
```

### `room_left`

Emitted after the client leaves a shipment room.

Payload example:

```json
{
  "shipmentId": "<shipmentId>",
  "room": "shipment_<shipmentId>"
}
```

### `error`

Socket.IO may also emit socket-level errors for authorization or room membership failures.

Payload example:

```json
{
  "code": "UNAUTHORIZED",
  "message": "Not allowed to view this shipment"
}
```

## Disconnect and cleanup behavior

- The server listens on `disconnecting` and logs room state for cleanup.
- It also removes the socket from the active user registry on `disconnect`.
- Clients should call `socket.disconnect()` when leaving the app or swapping contexts.

## SSE fan-out

Every Socket.IO emit listed above is also fanned out to Server-Sent Events (SSE) clients
via `safeFanout` in `src/infra/sse/fanout.ts`. The SSE stream at `GET /api/events`
receives identical payloads for `location:update`, `anomaly:detected`,
`shipment:status`, and `settlement:status`. This ensures parity between WebSocket
and SSE consumers without duplicating business logic.

## Notes

- The Socket.IO flow is implemented in `src/infra/socket/io.ts`.
- Room management helper logic is in `src/infra/socket/shipmentRooms.ts`.
- Payload schemas are defined in `src/shared/types/socketEvents.ts`.
- Settlement status updates emit `settlement:status` from `updatePaymentStatusService` and `disputeSettlementService` in `src/modules/payments/payments.service.ts`.
- `notification:new` is emitted via `emitNotificationNew()` and targets recipient-scoped rooms.
